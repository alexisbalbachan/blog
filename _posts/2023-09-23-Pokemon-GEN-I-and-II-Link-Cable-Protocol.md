## Motivation
I grew up in the midst of the pokemon craze in the 90s, in my school the series became popular first, and soon after everyone was bringing in their gameboys to play the Pokemon games on breaks.

Eventually my parents got me a brand new Gameboy Color alongside a Pokemon Red cartridge, so my quest for catching 'em all began! 

The most frustrating thing about those games was **trading**, not only did i have to find someone playing Pokemon blue and willing to trade with me, but that person also had to own a Link Cable.

Not many children at my school owned a Link Cable so i remember that completing my Pokedex was really **\*HARD\*** (My original save file is still alive btw!).

What about Mew? Well, a couple of years later i got a Gameshark which i used to capture it. The really interesting thing about all of this is that the Gameshark cartridge came with a Gameboy to PC(Parallel port) cable which is the closest thing i had which resembles a Link Cable:
