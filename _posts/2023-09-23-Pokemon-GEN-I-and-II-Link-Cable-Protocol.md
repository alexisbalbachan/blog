## Motivation
I grew up in the midst of the pokemon craze in the 90s, in my school the series became popular first, and soon after everyone was bringing in their gameboys to play the Pokemon games on breaks.

Eventually my parents got me a brand new Gameboy Color alongside a Pokemon Red cartridge, so my quest for catching 'em all began! 

The most frustrating thing about those games was **trading**, not only did i have to find someone playing Pokemon blue and willing to trade with me, but that person also had to own a Link Cable.

Not many children at my school owned a Link Cable so i remember that completing my Pokedex was really **\*HARD\*** (My original save file is still alive btw!).

What about Mew? Well, a couple of years later i got a Gameshark which i used to capture it.

The really interesting thing about all of this is that the Gameshark cartridge came with a Gameboy to PC(Parallel? port) cable which is the closest thing i had that resembles a Link Cable:

That cable was used to upload/download cheats into the Gameshark, also to update its firmware. So of course i had to try it... Which ended up bricking my precious Gameshark. Now with a useless cartrige, the cable ended up collecting dust for decades.

About 5 years ago i was tinkering with a raspberry pi and remembered **the cable**. Would it be possible to trade Pokemon between a Gameboy and a PC?

I started searching for any existing information about this subject and it was mainly all bad news:

(Note: I was and still am a complete noob at this kind of stuff)

* Gameboy to PC:
    * To this day i still don't know **HOW** this cable was originally used, is it serial? Is it parallel?
    * If serial: It seems that PC serial ports communicate using the RS232 protocol which works with voltage levels way beyond of the 0v/+5v signals that the Gameboy can handle (I've seen the name MAX-232 thrown around alot for adapting the signals) -> *Overwhelmed*.
    * If parallel: Voltage levels match, so far so good... But my PC doesn't have a parallel port anymore, even if i had one.. How would i control individual pins (either in Windows or Linux)? -> *Overwhelmed*.
* Gameboy to Raspberry Pi:
    * I already knew how to read from / write to individual pins, great!
    * **GPIO pins work with 3.3V and are NOT 5V tolerant** (DO NOT CONNECT RPI PINS TO A GAMEBOY DIRECTLY).
    * Intro to logic level converters before even connecting a single cable -> *Overwhelmed*.

The only thing that kept me going was [THIS BLOGPOST](http://www.adanscotney.com/2014/01/spoofing-pokemon-trades-with-stellaris.html) (Thank you [Adan Scotney](http://www.adanscotney.com)!) in which **someone** accomplished the exact same thing i was trying to do! However he used a.. "Stellaris Launchpad" which i had NO IDEA what it was (still don't know).

So i knew **it was possible**, it wasn't extremely difficult, and had all the information i needed to implement it on my own (or so i thought..). The only thing i didn't have at the time was the hardware which i had no intention of buying and just kept the idea in the back of my mind while working on other projects..


Fast forward to **2023**: I found out that Arduino boards were REALLY cheap (compared to a RPI), so i bought myself an Arduino Nano, a bunch of sensors, and started delving into the world of microcontrollers. Did some basic examples, then implemented communication protocols with different sensors until i felt ready for my next task: Trade pokemon between a PC and a Gameboy using the Arduino as an intermediary. \[**SPOILER: I DID IT!**\]
