## Motivation
I grew up in the midst of the pokemon craze in the 90s, in my school the TV series became popular first, and soon after everyone was bringing in their gameboys to play the Pokemon games on breaks.

Eventually my parents got me a brand new Gameboy Color alongside a Pokemon Red cartridge, so my quest for catching 'em all began! 

The most frustrating thing about those games was **trading**, not only did i have to find someone playing Pokemon blue and willing to trade with me, but that person also had to own a Link Cable.

Not many children at my school owned a Link Cable so completing my Pokedex was really **\*HARD\*** (My original save file is still alive btw!).

What about Mew? Well, a couple of years later i got a Gameshark which i used to capture it.

The really interesting thing about all of this is that the Gameshark cartridge came with a Gameboy to PC(Parallel? port) cable which is the closest thing i had that resembles a Link Cable:

 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/s-l1600.png" alt="Gameshark Link to PC Cable" style="width:500px;"/></p>
 <p align="center"><em>Gameboy to PC cable</em></p>

<!--![Gameshark Link to PC Cable](/docs/assets/images/s-l1600.png)-->

That cable was used to upload/download cheats into the Gameshark, also to update its firmware. So of course i had to try it... Which ended up bricking my precious Gameshark. Now with a useless cartrige, the cable ended up collecting dust for decades.

About 5 years ago, while tinkering with a raspberry pi i suddenly remembered **the cable**. Would it be possible to trade Pokemon between a Gameboy and a PC?

I started searching for any existing information about this subject and it was mainly all bad news:

(Note: I was and still am a complete noob at this kind of stuff)

* Gameboy to PC:
    * To this day i'm still not sure **HOW** this cable was originally used, is it serial? Is it parallel?
    * If serial: It seems that PC serial ports communicate using the RS232 protocol which works with voltage levels way beyond of the 0v/+5v signals that the Gameboy can handle (I've seen the name MAX-232 thrown around alot for adapting the signals) -> *Overwhelmed*.
    * If parallel: Voltage levels match, so far so good... But my PC doesn't have a parallel port anymore, even if i had one.. How would i control individual pins (either in Windows or Linux)? -> *Overwhelmed*.
* Gameboy to Raspberry Pi:
    * Already knew how to read from / write to individual pins, great!
    * **GPIO pins work with 3.3V and are NOT 5V tolerant** (DO NOT CONNECT RPI PINS TO A GAMEBOY DIRECTLY).
    * Intro to logic level converters before even connecting a single cable -> *Overwhelmed*.

<br>

The only thing that kept me going was [THIS BLOGPOST](http://www.adanscotney.com/2014/01/spoofing-pokemon-trades-with-stellaris.html) (Thank you [Adan Scotney](http://www.adanscotney.com)!) in which **someone** accomplished the exact same thing i was trying to do! However he used a.. "Stellaris Launchpad" which i had NO IDEA what it was (still don't know).

So i knew **it was possible**, it wasn't extremely difficult, and had all the information required to implement it on my own (or so i thought..). The only thing i didn't have at the time was the hardware which i had no intention of buying and just kept the idea in the back of my mind while working on other projects..


Fast forward to **2023**: I found out that Arduino boards were REALLY cheap (compared to a RPI), and bought myself an Arduino Nano, a bunch of sensors, and started delving into the world of microcontrollers. Did some basic examples, then implemented communication protocols with different sensors until i felt confident for my next task: Trade pokemon between a PC and a Gameboy using the Arduino as an intermediary. \[**SPOILER: I DID IT!**\]

## Introduction
The main goal of this post is to explain how trading works in pokemon red/blue/yellow and gold/silver/crystal in as much detail as possible, from the physical layer to the actual protocol implemented by those games. 

I'll also include the misconceptions and problems encountered along the way while implementing said protocol (many of the problems will look trivial to you!)

## Physical Layer


### Link Cable Pinout
The cable pins have already been described many times ([1], [2], [3])

                                                                  ___________
                                                                 |  2  4  6  |
                                                                  \_1__3__5_/

<div align="center">

| #           | Name        | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1           | VCC         | +5V         |
| 2           | SOUT        | Serial Out  | 
| 3           | SIN         | Serial In   | 
| 4           | Not Used    | Not Used    | 
| 5           | SCK         | Serial Clock| 
| 6           | GND         | Ground      | 

</div>

1. Gameboys are able to provide 5V through this pin, some (unofficial?) accessories use it (E.G: night lights), its not used when connected to another Gameboy.
2. Data is sent through this pin bit by bit. It is connected to SIN on the other side of the cable.
3. Data is received through this pin bit by bit. It is connected to SOUT on the other side of the cable.
4. Not used/Usage unknown/Haven't found any additional reference to this pin.
5. One Gameboy will generate a clock signal (see SPI section) in this pin to synchronize the transmission. Both Gameboys will read from and write into their corresponding pins only when the clock signal reaches specific states.
6. Ground reference pin so both Gameboys share a common ground (EXTREMELY IMPORTANT **\***).

\* My first mistake was ignoring the ground pin, i was just starting and tried to read what was being sent on each pin.. I remember reading the exact opposite of what was expected (E.G: Expected 101010 , got 010101 instead). I lost so much time trying to figure that out! The solution was connecting pin 6 to any of my arduino's GND pins.

### Signals

* Voltage levels on each pin should be either 0V (representing 0/LOW) or 5V (representing 1/HIGH).
* I haven't tested this, but lower voltages may still work (e.g 3V or 4V could also be considered as HIGH). Just make sure that whatever communicates with a Gameboy can tolerate 5V on its pins.
* I would't recommend using voltages higher than 5V as you could damage your Gameboy.

<br>

* Both SOUT and SIN normally stay at LOW (0V) when idle (it shouldn't really matter)
* SCK stays HIGH when idle, a pullup resistor will ensure that 5V are read even when there's nothing connected on the other end of the cable.
* Using a pulldown resistor on SCK should probably work, we're only looking to read a consistent value from that pin when the other side isn't transmitting anything (or isn't even connected), otherwise the value will fluctuate randomly and we may confuse those fluctuations with an actual clock signal!

### SPI

#### Concept

At this layer (physical) we'll only be concerned with transmitting bits and bytes, their actual meaning will be dealt with in higher layers.

SPI (**S**erial **P**eripheral **I**nterface) is a widely used communication protocol, its amazingly well documented ([4], [5], [6], [7], [8]) and is (in my opinion) quite easy to understand. 

At its most basic level it has 2 lines used for sending and receiving data, one line for syncronization between the 2 peers, and one line for signaling the beginning/end of the trasmission.

Why synchronization? Well, the peers need to know **when** to read from their input line and **when** to write into their output line, consider the following scenario:

 <p align="center"> Assuming LOW is 0 and HIGH is 1.. What binary number is being transmitted? </p>

 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/input_signal.png" alt="Mystery signal" style="width:500px;"/></p>
 
 The safest bet would be 000101010:
 
 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/input_signal1.png" alt="Interpretation1" style="width:500px;"/></p>

 But, there are other interpretations that are equally valid:

 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/input_signal2.png" alt="Interpretation2" style="width:500px;"/></p>

 Also, where does the transmission actually start? (and end?):
 
 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/input_signal3.png" alt="Interpretation3" style="width:500px;"/></p>

 I that even a single transmission?:
 
 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/input_signal4.png" alt="Interpretation4" style="width:500px;"/></p>

 <br>

SPI solves this problem by introducing a **shared clock** which indicates when to read from and write to the data lines.

<p align="center">A clock is just a signal that switches between HIGH and LOW at regular intervals:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/clocks.png" alt="Clock examples" style="width:500px;"/></p>

Where does the clock signal come from? One of the peers generates it while the other one just reads from that line!

* The peer that sends the signal is named **MASTER** (can be also named **CONTROLLER** or **MAIN**).
* The one that only reads from the clock line is called **SLAVE** (or **PERIPHERAL**, or even **TARGET**).
* Data lines are also named after those roles:
  * The line where the master writes into and the slave reads from is called **M**aster **O**ut **S**lave **I**n (**MOSI**).
    * It can also be called **C**ontroller **O**ut **P**eripheral **I**n (**COPI**).
    * Or **C**ontroller **O**ut **T**arget **I**n (**COTI**).
  * The line where the slave writes into and the master reads from is called  **M**aster **I**n **S**lave **O**ut (**MISO**).
    * It can also be called **C**ontroller **I**n **P**eripheral **O**ut (**CIPO**).
    * Or **C**ontroller **I**n **T**arget **O**ut (**CITO**).
* There is also a fourth signal which indicates when the transmission starts and ends:
  * This line is controlled by the master aswell.
  * Its called **S**lave **S**elect (**SS**), **C**hip **S**elect (**CS**), **C**hip **E**nable (**CE**).
  * NOTE: SPI can support multiple slave nodes, and each one needs to have a separate **SS** line to the master (other lines are shared). They will only communicate when their **SS** line is active.
* Both Master and Slave send and receive data at the same time.
 
<p align="center">Here's an example of what SPI transmissions looks like (MOSI: 1011, MISO: 0110)</p>

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/SPI_transmission.png" alt="Clock examples" style="width:500px;"/></p>

Note that **in this example** MOSI and MISO signals will only change when the clock signal is LOW.

* SPI operates in 4 different modes which are basically a set of rules that both master and slave have to agree upon beforehand.
* There are 2 parameters to consider:
  * Does the clock stay idle at HIGH or at LOW? This is called **C**lock **POL**arity (**CPOL**).
  * Is data read when the clock changes to LOW or to HIGH? and in that same line, is data written when the clock changes to LOW or to HIGH? This is called **C**lock **Pha**se (**CPHA**).
* Read/write should be done on **clock edges** which is the moment when the clock changes values, a rising edge goes from LOW to HIGH and a falling edge goes from HIGH to LOW.
* It's more important to write on time than to read on time, you can actually read your data whenever you want before the next clock edge.

<br>

<div align="center">

Here is a table briefly describing the 4 SPI modes:
  
| SPI Mode | Clock Polarity when idle | When to read/write (edges) |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| 0        |           LOW            | R on RISING / W on FALLING |
| 1        |           LOW            | R on FALLING / W on RISING |
| 2        |           HIGH           | R on FALLING / W on RISING |
| 3        |           HIGH           | R on RISING / W on FALLING |
  
</div>

<br>

Most SPI implementations will only work with message lengths that are multiple of 8 bits (so the smallest unit that can be sent is 1 byte)

There is an additional thing to consider and that is the bit order of the data being read/written:
* If you wanted to send any number, for example 42 whose binary representation is 00101010 then you could write it from right to left or from left to right.
  * Writing from left to right (0->0->1->0->1->0->1->0) means that we're writing from its most significant bit onward (**MSB**).
  * Writing from right to left (0->1->0->1->0->1->0->0) means that we're writing from its less significant bit onward (**LSB**).
* Whatever order is chosen, both ends must respect it when writing and reading from the data lines.
  * In our example if we read 42 in a different order (LSB instead of MSB or MSB instead of LSB) then we'll end up with a flipped number: 01010100 (84 in decimal).

#### How Gameboys Implement SPI

Here i'll describe some key aspects of the SPI implementation used by the Gameboys.

A detailed description about the implementation can be found [HERE](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Serial_Data_Transfer_%28Link_Cable%29.html) (Pandocs) and more importantly [HERE](https://ia803208.us.archive.org/9/items/GameBoyProgManVer1.1/GameBoyProgManVer1.1.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A158%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22FitH%22%7D%2C769%5D) (Gameboy Programming Manual Chapter 1 Section 2.4).

 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/SIO_block_diagram.png" alt="Serial communication block diagram" style="width:500px;"/></p>
 <p align="center"><em>Serial communication block diagram (Gameboy Programming Manual)</em></p>

<br>

* Gameboys use **SPI mode 3** when communicating through the link cable, so the clock signal stays HIGH when idle, data is written on falling edges and is read on rising edges.
* Data is transfered byte by byte, that means that once 8 bits are transfered, an interrupt will trigger to signal the software that a byte has arrived/has been sent.
* Bytes are written/read from their **M**ost **S**ignificant **B**it (**MSB**) onwards, i.e. from left to right.
* **THERE IS NO SS/CS LINE**: The master will just generate a clock signal and the slave will read/write from/into data lines as soon as it detects the corresponding clock edges.
* This should be obvious but got me confused at first: The clock signal will only exist when data is being transferred, for some reason i thought that it was always active as long as the connection was established.
* The original Gameboy can only generate a 8192Hz clock (1 cycle/bit every 122μs or every 0.000122 seconds!).
* Gameboy Color can generate clocks at 4 different frequencies: 8192Hz, 16384Hz, 262144Hz, and 524288Hz.
* Slave Gameboys have to adapt to any incoming clock signal, they support absurdly low speeds (even 1 cycle per month!) and up to 500KHz (original GB).
  
* **Master/Slave Negotiation**:
  * Gameboys first poll the clock line, if they find a clock signal then they'll act as a slave. If no signal is present then they'll start sending their own clock signal (thus becoming master).
  * This means that the first Gameboy that tries to initiate a connection will probably become master.
 

<br>

Things to keep in mind:

* Slave nodes **cannot** send anything on their own, they have to wait for the master's clock signal first (which happens only when the master wants to transfer something themselves).
* Similarly slaves are unable to signal if they're ready for the transfer or not, it will occur anyway and the master will read whatever is in its input signal.
* This is why master nodes need to be considerate and give some time between each transfer to make sure that the slave is ready for it!
* Transfers are simultaneous, but the slave may have to read something from its master before knowing **what** to send, so in many implementations slaves are 1 step behind their master:
  * (MASTER <-> SLAVE):  (1) REQUEST1 <-> NOTHING | (2) REQUEST2 <-> RESPONSE1 | (3) REQUEST3 <-> RESPONSE2 | etc.

<br>
<br>

#### Additional Restrictions in Pokemon Games

In the previous section i described the SPI capabilities of the Gameboy Hardware, **HOW** they'll be used depends on the software (i.e. the games):

* Pokemon Games will use the lowest clock speed for transmissions (8192Hz). I'm assuming that this is to support trades between any hardware (original GB, GBP, and GBC).
* There seems to be a limit on how SLOW a clock can be, so slaves will timeout if no clock edge is detected after a certain amount of time.
* I'm not sure if slave pokemon games would support much higher clock speeds than the standard rate (haven't tested it yet).
* It could be possible to change the clock rate at any time as long as it does no exceed the allowed limits.

## Pokemon Trading Protocol

All the information provided in previous sections was tiresome to come by, as it's scattered all over the internet. But the important thing is that **it exists**!

As mentioned before, i could only find **one** single resource that touches on this topic ([Check it out!](http://www.adanscotney.com/2014/01/spoofing-pokemon-trades-with-stellaris.html)). It was crucial for my project and for my understanding of the protocol, however it came with several issues:
* The provided protocol description is.. vague to say the least (but a good place to start!)
* Both the protocol description and the provided PoC **are incomplete** (Barely enough to trade pokemon in the simplest scenarios).
* The code heavily relies on mirroring data to work (which may break some trades).
* It also expects the user to provide a valid buffer (which represents their pokemon data). The buffer itself has to follow certain rules not mentioned elsewhere!
* Some code may be missing (the demo video shows 2 pokemon being traded, but the code itself only reaches the trade screen).
* It only focuses on **Gen I**.

There are other resources available that implement the trading protocol but unfortunately it seems that all of them are heavily based on the one mentioned above (some even use the exact same code).

The actual trading algorithms implemented in the games are available [HERE (Pokered: GEN I)](https://github.com/pret/pokered/blob/b302e93674f376f2881cbd931a698345ad27bec3/engine/link/cable_club.asm) and [HERE (Pokegold: GEN II)](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/70f883dc8670c95f411a9bbfa6ff13c44c027632/engine/link/link.asm). Both projects were really helpful but the code is written in pure Gameboy assembly (similar to Z80) with little to no comments.

I'll describe the trading protocol for generation I first, then include how generation II differs from it and what was added (both generations have a lot in common so its important to read both sections).
 
### Generation I

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_welcome.png" alt="Cable Club Welcome!" style="width:500px;"/></p>

<div align="center">

<hr>
<br>
  
#### Handshake

The first Gameboy to initiate the connection (by talking to the Cable Club NPC at the Pokemon Center) will probe the SCK line and won't find any clock signal there, thus becoming **master**.
It will repeatedly send **0x01** looking for a response on the other side, the slave gameboy must always reply with **0x02** (everytime it receives 0x01). 

Note that the slave gameboy won't reply to the first 0x01 because it can only reply to what it has already been received, (the master->slave and slave->master transmission happens at the same time!) so the first message will always be replied with 0x00:

| #MSG | MASTER | SLAVE              |
|------|--------|--------------------|
|1     | 0x01   | 0x00               |
|2     | 0x01   | REPLY for #1 HERE  |

On my tests, the master kept trying to establish a connection approximately 89 times (i.e. sends 0x01 89 times with no response on the other side):

| #MSG | MASTER | SLAVE |
|------|--------|-------|
|1     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|2     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|3     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|4     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|5     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|......|........|.......|
|89    | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|90    | ABORT  | ABORT |

Only one 0x02 response is needed for the master to accept the handshake, further responses are ignored, they can be of any value (i'd recommend to keep responding with 0x02):

Expected successful handshake:

| #MSG | MASTER           | SLAVE                 |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|
|1     | 0x01             | 0x00                  |
|2     | 0x01             | 0x02 (Responds to #1) |
|3     | ACKNOWLEDGED!    | 0x02 (Responds to #2) |
|4     | .................| ......................|

Abnormal successful handshake (still valid):

| #MSG | MASTER           | SLAVE                 |
|------|------------------|-----------------------|
|1     | 0x01             | 0x00                  |
|2     | 0x01             | 0x02 (Responds to #1) |
|3     | ACKNOWLEDGED!    | **0x99** (Responds to #2) |
|4     | .................| ......................|

Once a handshake is accepted by the master, it acknowledges it by sending **0x00** (a very bad choice for an acknowledge, it is the same as not sending anything!). The slave must also reply with **0x00**, in my tests the acknowledge happens twice (both master and slave send 0x00 two times in a row)

**A complete handshake looks like this:**

| #MSG | MASTER | SLAVE |
|------|--------|-------|
|1     | 0x01   | 0x00  |
|2     | 0x01   | 0x02  |
|3     | 0x00   | 0x02  |
|4     | 0x00   | 0x00  |
|5     | 0x00   | 0x00  |

After a handshake both players are asked to save the game.

<hr>
<br>

#### Players Ready


<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_save.png" alt="Saving game before continuing" style="width:500px;"/></p>

The master won't send anything else until the player saves the game, similarly the slave will always reply with 0x00 until its player also saves their game.

Once the master saved its game it will repeatedly send **0x60** (to signal that it's ready) until it receives **0x60** as well. It will abort and disconnect after several seconds of not receiving that same value! (it sends 0x00 before disconnecting)

Note: The games actually check that the **highest nibble (4 bits) is 6**, so any response between 0x60 and 0x6F is accepted. Gen II games use this feature to identify themselves when using the [Time Capsule](#time-capsule) (only gen I <--> gen II trades are allowed, not gen II <--> gen II).

| #MSG   | MASTER      | SLAVE |

|X       | 0x60        | 0x00  |
|X+1     | 0x60        | 0x00  |
|X+2     | 0x60        | 0x00  |

|X+7679  | 0x60        | 0x00  |
|X+7680  | ABORT(0x00) | 0x00  |

After saving its game the slave will also abort after some time without any messages coming from the master, but because it cannot send anything on its own it will just disconnect:

| #MSG   | MASTER      | SLAVE                 |
|--------|-------------|-----------------------|
|X       | FIRST 0x60  | ALREADY DISCONNECTED  |

<br><br>

If both players are ready on that time window then the slave will be responding with 0x60 everytime it receives that value. This can happen multiple times until the master acknowledges it (sending **0x00**, the default acknowledge message). The slave will also reply the acknowledge message with its own acknowledge (also **0x00**):

| #MSG | MASTER       | SLAVE       |

|X     | 0x60 (FIRST) | 0x00        |

#### Room Selection

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_room_select.png" alt="Players choose what they want to do" style="width:500px;"/></p>

This is where players select what they want to do: **Trade, Battle (Colosseum), or Cancel**. They can also exit the menu (by pressing **B**) at any time.

Both gameboys will continuously send which menu is currently being selected, the messages are sent twice and then there's one acknowledge before repeating the loop:


| #MSG    | MASTER       | SLAVE       |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
|X        | MENU MSG #1  | 0x00        |
|X+1      | MENU MSG #2  | MENU MSG #1 |
|X+2      | 0x00         | MENU MSG #2 |
|X+3      | MENU MSG #1  | 0x00        |
|X+4      | MENU MSG #2  | MENU MSG #1 |
|X+5      | 0x00         | MENU MSG #2 |
|X+6      | MENU MSG #1  | 0x00        |
|X+7      | MENU MSG #2  | MENU MSG #1 |
|X+8      | 0x00         | MENU MSG #2 |
|INFINITY | ............ | ........... |


<br>

Menu messages have the following format:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>HEX:</td>
    <td colspan="4">0xD</td>
    <td colspan="4">0xY</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Binary:</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>y</td>
    <td>y</td>
    <td>y</td>
    <td>y</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Meaning:</td>
    <td colspan="4">PREFIX</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td colspan="2">#M</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

The highest 4 bits of menu messages are always **0xD**.

The lowest 4 bits are the ones describing the action:

| Symbol| Description                   |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| B     | 1 if Player pressed "B"       |
| A     | 1 if Player pressed "A"       |
| #M    | Menu item number (0, 1, or 2) |

</div>

* #M = 0: Trade, #M = 1: Colosseum, #M = 2: Cancel
* Colosseum takes priority over Cancel so #M = 3 (1 and 2 at the same time) is considered Colosseum (it shouldn't be a valid message anyways!).
* If both A and B are 0 then #M indicates which item is currently being highlighted.
* If B is 1 then the player quit the selection menu while #M was being highlighted, it is considered as a cancel. Both gameboys disconnect.
* B takes priority over A, so if both A and B are 1 then it will also be treated as a cancel (This type of message shouldn't exist under normal circumnstances).
* If A is 1 then the player selected #M in the menu.
  * If A is 1 and #M is 2 then the player chose "Cancel" both gameboys will abort and disconnect right now.
* **The first player that selects (or cancels) something will pick that option for both of them!**
* The selection will be made effective once the master ends an iteration (after sending an acknowledge(0x00)). The selection loop ends there and the master stops communicating (for now).
 
<br>

<div align="center">
  
Here's how it looks like when players select and choose the trade option in the menu (slave chose first!):


| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|

|X+3      | 0xD0   | 0x00 |
|X+4      | 0xD0   | **0xD4** |
|X+5      | 0x00   | **0xD4** |
|X+6      | DONE   | DONE |

<hr><br>

#### Players Ready for Trade

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_room_ready.png" alt="Players about to interact with the trading machine." style="width:500px;"/></p>

This step is very similar to [Players Ready](#players-ready)

</div>

**Both players are now in the trade room!** Here, they're expected to press "A" facing the trading machine.
Any other action (walking around) isn't communicated to the other peer! The cable can even be unplugged and nothing will break.

When the master is ready (presses "A"), it will first send a single **0xFE** which means that it doesn't have any remaining data to send (i'm not sure **WHY** it would have something else to send at this point). Followed by an endless stream of **0x60** until it receives several 0x60 from the slave as well. **There isn't a timeout here**. The master will be stuck waiting until the Gameboy is turned off.

The same happens with the slave when it iteracts with the machine: It will wait for the master to communicate (and respond with a single 0xFE at first followed by 0x60 on subsequent transmissions). If the master never communicates then it will be stuck forever until the gameboy is turned off.

After receiving many successful responses, the master will send a stream of 0x00 before continuing.

Note: Just as with the initial [Handshake](#handshake), the only thing that games care about 0x60 is its highest nibble (6), so valid values are 0x60 to 0x6F (only 0x60 is used in both gen I and gen II games).

<div align="center">

Here's what it looks like when both gameboys are ready (Master was ready first):

| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|
|---------|--------|------|
|X        | 0xFE   | 0x00 |
|X+1      | 0x60   | 0x00 |
|X+2      | 0x60   | 0x00 |
|X+3      | 0x60   | 0x00 |
| ....... | ...... | .... |
|X+5000   | 0x60   | 0xFE |
|X+5001   | 0x60   | 0x60 |
|X+5002   | 0x60   | 0x60 |
|X+5003   | 0x60   | 0x60 |
|X+5004   | 0x60   | 0x60 |

|x+5014   | 0x00   | 0x60 |
|x+5015   | 0x00   | 0x00 |

#### Seed Exchange

</div>

 <p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_wait.png" alt="Games are exchanging the necessary information" style="width:500px;"/></p>

A random seed is used when battling in order to calculate things like critical hits, misses, etc. However, they are also exchanged when trading even though they have no use there!
Master and slave will exchange 10 random numbers between 1 and 252 (0xFC)

First the master will send **0xFD** (which is used as a **preamble** before a block of data is exchanged) repeatedly until it receives the same answer from the slave (it needs multiple successful answers before continuing, probably as a sync mechanism).

If the slave never responds with 0xFD, then the master will be stuck waiting forever.

Seed values go from 1 to 0xFC, so the first number in that range after the preamble stream is considered as the first seed value, and the subsequent 9 values are expected to be the remaining part of the seed (a total of 10 bytes).

I haven't tested what happens when sending 0xFD/0xFE/0xFF as part of the seed (which shouldn't happen).

<div align="center">

A normal seed exchange (Master seed: A0-A9, Slave seed: B0-B9)


| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|
|---------|--------|------|
|X        | 0xFD   | 0x00 |
|X+1      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+2      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |

#### Party Information Exchange


</div>


<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_party.png" alt="Final result after all the exchanges" style="width:500px;"/></p>

This step is almost exactly the same as the seed exchange but with a bigger payload. Immediately after exchanging seeds, the master will start sending several **0xFD** as a preamble, and again, the slave must also reply with 0xFD or else the other side will be stuck waiting forever.

The exchange will start after the first non 0xFD byte appears and a total of **415 bytes** will be exchanged.

There's only one restriction: **The payload must not contain 0xFE**. 0xFE means that there is no more data to be exchanged, i'm not exactly sure how it works internally, but once the exchange ends the other side will just ignore everything after that byte (it's like an end of buffer marker or something like that).

What happens when 0xFE is part of the payload? It needs to be patched (see [Patch Section](#patch-section)). To keep it simple for now: **Each 0xFE byte is replaced with 0xFF before being sent**.

<div align="center">

A normal exchange (Preamble + 415 bytes):


| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|
|---------|--------|------|
|X-10     | 0xFD   | 0x00 |
|X-9      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X-8      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
| ....... | ...... | .... |
|X        | 0x80   | 0xFD |
|X+1      | 0x88   | 0x82 |
|X+2      | 0x88   | 0x88 |
|X+3      | 0x95   | 0x90 |
| ....... | ...... | .... |
|X+414    | 0x50   | 0x80 |
|X+415    | END    | 0x50 |
|X+416    | END    | END  |

#### Data Structure

</div>

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_stats.png" alt="Stats of a pokemon" style="width:500px;"/></p>


* This is not part of the protocol per se, but it's important to understand **WHAT** is being exchanged in those 415 bytes as it affects the final result.

* There are many strings within that payload, they use **custom encodings (not ASCII!)**, which depends on the game's language (that's why trading between games of different languages will break their save files!).

* Those encodings are pretty well documented here: [Bulbapedia-> Character Encoding (Generation I)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Character_encoding_(Generation_I)).



<div align="center">

A few examples:

| Character | English Encoding | Japanese Encoding |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
|     A     |       0x80       |        0x60       |
|     B     |       0x81       |        0x61       |
|     a     |       0xA0       |   DOES NOT EXIST! |
|     5     |       0xFB       |        0xFB       |
|     ポ    |  DOES NOT EXIST! |        0x43       |

<br><br>

##### Trainer Name

</div>

* Bytes [0:10] (first 11 Bytes) correspond with the trainer's name which is displayed on the trade menu.
* The name itself is actually shorter, up to 10 bytes long, the extra byte is reserved for the string terminator (**0x50** in any encoding).
* Characters after 0x50 are ignored, they're usually **0x00**.
* A 3 byte name will have 0x50 at its fourth byte (followed by 0x00 afterwards), whereas a 10 byte name will have 0x50 in the (reserved) eleventh byte.
* I haven't tested what could happen if no string terminator is present or if we sent a 11 character string.
* **THIS NAME CANNOT BE PATCHED**. It cannot contain 0xFE (**"8"**), this can't happen without cheats/glitches because the in-game's keyboard doesn't have any numbers! This means you can't give a name with numbers to your player. (see [Patch Section](#patch-section))
* **IT CAN'T START WITH 0xFD ("7")** as it will be interpreted as part of the preamble, messing up everything that comes after! Same as above, names don't usually contain numbers without cheats/glitches.
* **IT CAN'T START WITH NULL CHARACTERS (0x00)**. Also an invalid name because not only it's empty, but also its first character isn't 0x50! Anyways, null characters will be interpreted as acknowledges and therefore skipped.

<br><br>
<div align="center">

##### Party Size

</div>

* Byte [11]. This is only one byte with a value between 1 and 6. It specifies how many pokemon are there in the trainer's party.
* It's the only way of telling the other side that your party is smaller than 6, you have to exchange 415 bytes no matter how many pokemon you have! By specifying a smaller party size, the other peer will ignore the extra bytes (corresponding to non existing pokemon).
* [Glitch] if its bigger than expected (e.g: 6 when we only have 3 pokemon), the empty/random data corresponding to non existing party members will be interpreted as pokemon too!
* Things i haven't tested:
  * What happens if party size is 0.
  * What happens if party size is greater than 6.
  * What happens if it's exactly 0xFE.
 
<br><br>
 
<div align="center">

##### Pokemon Id List

</div>

* Bytes [12:19]. This is a fixed length list which contains up to 6 elements plus a terminator.
* It contains the id numbers of each pokemon in the party. The first id corresponds to the first pokemon in the party, the second id to the second pokemon, and so on..
* **Id numbers are NOT the same as pokedex numbers**. Pokemon in generation I have a hidden id number.
* A list of pokemon with their corresponding id numbers can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> List of Pokemon by index number (Generation I)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_index_number_(Generation_I)).
* Note: Starting from generation II those hidden pokemon ids were replaced by the actual pokedex numbers (which makes more sense!).

<br>
  
* The list terminator (**0xFF**) goes after the id of last pokemon in the party.
* Parties with fewer than 6 pokemon will complete the list with that same terminator (0xFF).
* Values after the first list terminator are **ignored**, so it's not strictly necessary to keep sending 0xFF, any value will do **except 0xFE** (Time Capsule in Gen II fills the remaining bytes with 0x00!).
* The statement above is only valid if the [party size](#party-size) matches whatever is being sent here (e.g: a party of 3 should have 0xFF at the fourth byte).
  * The [party size](#party-size) indicates how many bytes have to be read from the list **no matter what**, so with an abnormally large party size the list terminator will be interpreted as another pokemon (and the bytes that follow it too!).
  * [Glitch] If a pokemon with 0xFF as its id is being traded then **it will become invisible** (because 0xFF actually indicates the end of the list, which seems to be used when rendering pokemon names in the trade menu). However it is still selectable! (the selection cursor is able to go below the last displayed pokemon and ends up pointing at the corresponding blank space).
    * Every pokemon below the one with 0xFF as its id will also become **invisible but selectable** (same reason, 0xFF indicates the end of the list)!
  * [Glitch] Pokemon with 0xFE as their id will completely mess up the trade data, shifting it by one byte (for each 0xFE).
* **THIS LIST CANNOT BE PATCHED**. So 0xFE shouldn't be sent (see above). That's ok because there isn't a valid pokemon whose id is 0xFE.  (see [Patch Section](#patch-section))

<br>

<div align="center">

Some examples:

<br>

A full party (Venasaur, Rhydon, Seel, Mewtwo, Mew, Charmander):

| Byte  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Value |0x9A|0x01|0x58|0x83|0x15|0x80|0xFF|

<br>

Party with a single pokemon (Bulbasaur):

| Byte  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Value |0x99|0xFF|0xFF|0xFF|0xFF|0xFF|0xFF|

<br>

Same party but with random numbers after the first list terminator (unusual but still valid):

| Byte  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Value |0x99|**0xFF**|0xDE|0xCA|0xF0|0xFA|0xDE|

<br>

[Glitch] Party of 3 with 2 invisible pokemon (Bulbasaur, [invisible] **'M**, [invisible] Bulbasaur ):

| Byte  |  0 |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Value |0x99|0xFF|0x99|**0xFF**|0xFF|0xFF|0xFF|


</div>

<br><br>

<div align="center">

##### Pokemon Structure (x6)

</div>

Bytes [20:284] are 6 contiguous data structures (44 bytes long each). The structure itself describes the attributes of a single pokemon, so naturally there's a structure for every pokemon in the player's party.

If the player has less than 6 Pokemon, the remaining structures will be copies of the previous ones (E.G: A party of 2 will still have 6 structures but the last one will be repeated 4 times to replace the 4 missing pokemon: 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2). Those structures will be ignored anyway, so there's no real need to repeat the last structure (any value will do).

Structures cannot contain **0xFE**. but it **CAN BE PATCHED** (and it will be replaced by 0xFF).  (see [Patch Section](#patch-section))

A summary of the structure's fields can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> Pokemon data structure (Generation I)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_(Generation_I)).

I'll also describe them here:

* [0] **Pokemon species Id**: As mentioned in [Pokemon Id List](#pokemon-id-list) each gen I pokemon has a hidden id which is different from its pokedex number (gen II just uses pokedex numbers). It should match with the one provided in the [Pokemon Id List](#pokemon-id-list).
  *  **Hybrid Pokemon**: If this id differs from the one in the id list this pokemon becomes an unstable hybrid ([Bulbapedia -> Unstable Hybrid Pokemon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Unstable_hybrid_Pok%C3%A9mon). This field corresponds to the recipient species, which is the "real" value. The value in the id list is the donor species.
* [1:2] **Current HP** (2 bytes, big endian, unsigned). Its value goes from 0 to 65535, **it can even be higher than the pokemon's max HP without any problem**.
* \[3] **Box Level**: From 0 to 255. This is NOT the actual pokemon level, i think that it's the level value displayed when browsing pokemon on Bill's PC. It can be completely ignored.
* \[4] **Status Condition**: Each bit represents a status, i could only find information on the meaning of 5 out of 8 bits (SLP, PSN, BRN, FRZ, PAR. Check the Bulbapedia link above) and i don't know what happens when multiple statuses are present at the same time.
  * I suspect the missing statuses are confusion, badly poisoned, and leech seeded (which cannot happen outside battles).
  
<div align="center">


| Bits  | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Value |PAR|FRZ|BRN|PSN|SLP|???|???|???|


</div>

* \[5] and \[6] **Type 1** and **Type 2**:
  * Pokemon with only one type will have both types set to the same value.
  * **Types are overriden by the default type of the pokemon species**. So if you tried to send a fire/psychic type Bulbasaur, the other gameboy will just ignore those bytes and just show a grass/poison Bulbasaur. It's not a display bug, this change is permanent! When trading back that same Bulbasaur we will see that the typing bytes were reverted to their default values.
  * There are 255 available types, most of which are glitch types. Some glitch types share the same name as valid types!
  * The only way to obtain a glitch type pokemon by trading is to receive a glitch pokemon that coincidentaly has a glitch type by default. (Non default types are ignored, read above)
  * A complete list of **valid** types can be found on the [Bulbapedia link](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_(Generation_I)).
* \[7] **Catch Rate**: From 0 to 255, every pokemon species has a fixed catch rate, this value won't change even when that pokemon evolves. It represents an item in gen II so by modifying this value you could trade a pokemon holding (almost) any item to a gen II game.
* \[8], \[9], \[10], \[11]: Id of moves 1, 2, 3, and 4. Gen I only has 165 valid moves (1-165). Id 0 means EMPTY. Ids > 165 are glitch moves.
  * [Glitch] Sending a pokemon with any moves AFTER an empty move will cause the game to recognize that empty id as a glitch move! Normally empty moves are at the end of the move menu, here we're forcing an empty move to go above a non empty move.
  * Pokemon with no moves can be traded.
  * Pokemon with repeated moves can be traded.
  * Moves have hardcoded types, categories(physical/special/status), power, accuracy, and max PP depending on the id.
  * A complete list of valid moves for each generation can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> List of moves](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_moves).
* [12:13] **Original Trainer ID** (2 bytes, big endian, unsigned): This is the id of the trainer which caught this pokemon, it is used to check whether you're the original owner of it or not (it may not obey you depending on lvl/badges obtained). Pokemon belonging to other trainers also gain more experience per battle.
* [14:16] **Experience Points** (3 bytes, big endian, unsigned): Total experience gained, goes from 0 to 16777215. Pokemon need to reach a certain amount of experience in order to level up, having a higher amount of experience than required for that level may prevent your pokemon from leveling entirely (i haven't tested it yet).
  * Experience points necessary to level up depend on the experience category of the pokemon species: [Bulbapedia -> List of Pokemon by experience type](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_experience_type).
  * Experience formulas can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> Experience -> Relation to level](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Experience#Relation_to_level)
* [17:18], [19:20], [21:22], [23:24], [25:26]: **Effort Values (EVs)** for Health, Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special (2 bytes each, big endian, unsigned).
  * They're basically experience points for each stat. The final value of the stats will slightly increase when their EV's are high enough.
  * They're gained when defeating other pokemon (based on its stats).
  * **EVs are ignored on traded pokemon until you deposit and withraw them**. This forces the game to recalculate pokemon stats. (see [Bulbapedia -> Box Trick](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Box_trick)).
* [27:28]: **Individual Values (IVs)** for Attack, Defense, Speed, and Special. They're hidden values from 0 to 15 which are also used to calculate the final value of a pokemon's stats. A higher IV results in higher stats. IV values are randomized when encountering wild pokemon and there's no way to change them (without glitches/cheats). **Pokemon are shiny if they have specific IV values** (although they'll still look normal in gen I games). a pokemon's gender is also determined by IVs (depending on its species).
  * Each stat IV consists in 4 bits, so naturally the 4 IV stats will occupy 16 bits / 2 bytes.
  * Health IV is calculated from the IVs of the other stats. Specifically, the last bit of each stat.

  * Once the pokemon is stored and then withrawn from a PC box, its stats will be recalculated, overriding any previous value. Pokemon Stadium will also recalculate stats when registering pokemon into a team.

<div align="center">

##### Original Owner Name (x6)

</div>

* This is the name of the trainer who caught this pokemon (that's why it's named *original* owner). It's used along with the Original Trainer's ID in order to determine if the current player is the original owner of this pokemon. There're some advantages to being the original owner of a pokemon (it will obey you no matter what!) and a disadvantage (they will gain xp at a standard rate while not owned pokemon will get bonus xp per battle).
* It's a string, so it's almost the same as [Trainer Name](#trainer-name): Uses custom a encoding (not ASCII), 11 bytes, max length of 10, terminates with 0x50, bytes following 0x50 are usually 0x00:
  * It cannot contain 0xFE but this time it **CAN BE PATCHED**.  (see [Patch Section](#patch-section))
  * Something interesting that i have found is that the encoding allows some words to be encoded as one byte. For example 0x5D represents the string "TRAINER", so its possible to have names longer than 10 if we use those special words: 0x5D5D5D5D5D5D5D5D5D5D50 is a *valid* name as it only occupies 10 bytes, but it's actually 70 characters long!
  * There's one in-game trade which gives you a Mr.Mime nicknamed "Marcel", its original owner's name is "TRAINER" encoded as a single 0x5D (followed by the 0x50 terminator)!
* If the party is smaller than 6, the remaining fields will be a copy of the last one (if there's only 1 pokemon, then all of the 6 fields will be the same!).
  * It shouldn't really matter because extra fields are ignored. They could have any value.

##### Pokemon Nickname (x6)

</div>

* This is the pokemon's nickname if it has one. Otherwise the name **must** match the name of the pokemon species (E.G. A Bulbasaur with no nickname should have "BULBASAUR" on this field)
* Also 11 bytes long, terminated with 0x50, uses the same encoding.
* It can also be patched.  (see [Patch Section](#patch-section))
* Same behaviour if the party is less than 6 (repeats last name until 6 fields are sent)
* The only difference is that every character after 0x50 is also 0x50 (i'm no sure why, maybe an oversight or a way to differentiate a nickname from the species name).

##### Owned Pokemon Bytes (x3)

</div>

* There're **3 more bytes** before the patch section. **They're basically useless** as they represent incomplete data and have nothing to do with the trade itself!

* The games store pokedex data (owned pokemon and seen pokemon) as an array of bytes, each bit representing a pokemon. When a bit is set to 1 then that pokemon is owned (or seen).

* The owned pokemon array starts immediately after the player's party data.

* When exchanging party data, for some reason (**probably a mistake**) 3 extra bytes are sent, which belong to the first 3 bytes of the player's owned pokemon array:
  * To be precise, those bytes indicate if the player owns (or not) the first 24 pokemon of the pokedex.
    
* 0xFE can be sent in this section, so i'm assuming that this part doesn't need to be patched (or the game doesn't care about it).
 


<div align="center">

As an example, if the player only owned Bulbasaur, Metapod, and Spearrow, then those 3 bytes would be:

| Byte  |    1     |     2    |     3    |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| Bin   | 00000001 | 00000100 | 00010000 |
| Hex   |   0x01   |   0x04   |   0x10   |

</div>

<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Patch Section

</div>

At this point both players have already transfered their payloads (which contained information about them and their pokemon). Those payloads **couldn't contain 0xFE** as this byte signals the premature end of the stream (the other side will basically ignore everything received after that!).

As you may have seen in the previous section [Data Structure](#data-structure), some (if not all) pokemon properties **can end up containing that value**, some examples are:

<br>

* Current/Max HP being 254 (0x00**FE**), 510 (0x01**FE**), 766 (0x02**FE**), 1022 (0x03**FE**), and so on. Also any value above 65024 (0x**FE**00), which can only be obtained by cheating.
* Same with stats EVs (which are basically experience points for stats, 2 bytes each).
* Same with Attack/Defense/Speed/Special stats but their values are usually lower than 254.
* Trainer ID: It's randomly generated when starting a new game so you could end up with any of the values above.
* Experience points, 254, 510, 766, 1022... any value between 65024 (0x00**FE**00) and 65279 (0x00**FE**FF), also 65790 (0x0100**FE**), anything above 16646144 (0x**FE**0000), etc.
* Stats IVs: Attack IV = 15 and Defense IV = 14 (1111 1110 = 0xFE), or Speed IV = 15 and Special IV = 14.
* Level: 254 but can only be reached with cheats/glitches.

Some properties **can** contain 0xFE in their values, but are restricted by in-game mechanics from doing so. I think that those restrictions were intentionally implemented for this purpose. Otherwise they don't make any sense:
* PP Values: Can theoretically reach 0xFE (3 PP ups and 62 PP remaining 11|111110, 3|62 = 0xFE) **BUT** the games restrict max PP values to 61.
* Names (Original Trainer / Pokemon Nicknames): 0xFE represents the character '**8**' which cannot be legally present (in-game keyboards do not have numbers!).

<br>

Players need to send their payloads even if they contain 0xFE, so they **patch** them: First, every instance of **0xFE is replaced with 0xFF** (unless specified otherwise in [Data Structure](#data-structure)) before being sent. Now, both players will send a list of **offsets** that specify which bytes need to be changed back into 0xFE.

<br>
<br>

<div align="center">
  
##### Preamble

</div>


Just as in [Seed Exchange](#seed-exchange) and [Party Information Exchange](#party-information-exchange), a preamble consisting in multiple 0xFD bytes is sent (usually 6 bytes), after that another stream of bytes is exchanged, this time it's 0x00. The first non 0x00 byte marks the start of the patch list.

<div align="center">

What a normal patch section preamble looks like:

| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|
|---------|--------|------|
|X        | 0xFD   | 0x00 |
|X+1      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+2      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+3      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+4      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+5      | 0xFD   | 0xFD |
|X+6      | 0x00   | 0xFD |
|X+7      | 0x00   | 0x00 |
|X+8      | 0x00   | 0x00 |
|X+9      | 0x00   | 0x00 |

|X+11     | 0x00   | 0x00 |
|X+12     | 0x00   | 0x00 |
|X+13     | PATCH  | 0x00 |
|X+14     | PATCH  | PATCH |

<br>
<br>

##### Stages

</div>

A patch list should indicate which bytes in the *party information* payload ([Party Information Exchange](#party-information-exchange)) are actually **0xFE**, that value couldn't be sent due to restrictions in the protocol (it is a control byte) so it was replaced with **0xFF** and now needs to be changed back!

The simplest solution would be to send a **list of offsets**, each one pointing to a byte in the payload, and that byte would need to be changed back into 0xFE.

Now, remember that the payload is 415 bytes long. 1 byte per offset is not enough (goes from 0 to 255) so to represent any offset within the payload we would need 2 bytes which are way overkill as they can represent any value between 0 to 65535. It also wastes a lot of memory and increases the transfer time (due to bigger list items).

The games solve this issue by **logically spliting the payload in 2, and then sending 2 patch lists**, each one containing byte sized offsets which point to either the first or second half of the payload.

* The first list, which points to the first half of the payload is considered **Stage 1** of the patch section, while the second list (pointing to the second half) will be **Stage 2**.
* The byte **0xFF** is used to mark the end of the lists. So an empty list will be just [0xFF], and a list with only one element will be [0xYY, 0xFF].
* Lists cannot contain offsets with the following values:
  * 0x00: Represents NULL data, sent after the end of the list (as a fill-byte).
  * 0xFD: Control byte. [Preamble](#preamble).
  * 0xFE: Control byte. Indicates that there's nothing to send (or not ready).
  * 0xFF: Control byte. Indicates the end of the list.
* This leaves us with a range of **1-252 (0xFC)**, so offsets **start at 1 (not 0)**.
* Stage 1 offsets start at the first byte of the first pokemon in the party (Byte 19 of the payload) ([Pokemon Structure (x6)](#pokemon-structure-x6)). **That's why anything before that couldn't be patched**
* Stage 2 offsets start exactly 252 bytes after that (Byte 271 of the payload). At the sixth pokemon's 4th move's PP values.

<br> <br>
  
Here's a complete payload, byte values represent their corresponding offset. **||** Separates stage 1 and 2. Bytes marked as **XX** are unpatchable.

##### Restrictions

</div>

* The entire patch section (list 1 + list 2, including list terminators) has to be shorter than 190 bytes, that means that only 188 bytes can be patched without breaking the protocol:
  * You **can** send only one list containing 190 offsets without a list terminator and the other side will allow it! (it does break the protocol but no one thought about this case).
  * Furthermore, the second list terminator is entirely optional! Only the first one is used (to discriminate between the first and second stage).
  * Note: The code actually uses a 200 byte buffer for the patch lists but for some reason the first 10 bytes are skipped (index starts at 10).
* Realistically, games wouldn't be able to reach the 188 patch limit:
  * A pokemon species cannot be 0xFE (Glitch pokemon 'M).
  * Their max HP (and current HP) can reach 254 (0x00FE) but not anywhere near 65024 (0xFE00), so only the lowest of the 2 HP bytes can contain 0xFE.
  * Level and box level are capped at 100 (without glitches).
  * Statuses could never be 0xFE (legally).
  * Types 1 are 2 cannot be 0xFE (it is a glitch type).
  * There isn't any pokemon with a catch rate of 254, and 254 is an invalid item index (glitch item HM12).
  * Move indexes only reach 165 (gen I) and 251 (gen I) so 254 is a glitch move.
  * Moves PP values cannot reach 254 (would mean a 62 PP move with 3 PP UPs but the game caps PP at 61).
  * Only the lowest byte of pokemon stats can reach 254 (without cheats).
  * Trainer Names can't contain numbers ('8' is encoded as 254).
  * Nicknames can't contain numbers ('8' is encoded as 254).
* Doing a rough (and generous) estimate, the games would need 180 bytes at the absolute worst case (without any glitches).
* **Any offset after the patch limit is reached (188) won't be sent** (but could affect things on YOUR side, see [Buffer Overflow](#buffer-overflow)):
  * **Games are hardcoded to always exchange the 190 bytes of the patch buffer** even if there's nothing to patch (0x00 is sent repeatedly in those cases).

<br> <br>
<div align="center">
  
##### Buffer Overflow

</div>

* Anytime 0xFE is found in the payload its offset will be recorded in the patch buffer and that buffer's index will be increased by 1. The buffer's size is 200 but its index starts at 10, resulting in **190 available bytes for recording offsets**.

* If we manage to have **more than 190 bytes to patch** then the games will increase the buffer's index beyond its maximum size, writing the extra offsets in unexpected memory regions (i think that the next 200 bytes belong to the enemy's patch list, not sure what's after that). The game's code doesn't validate index values, and there's no memory protection!

* We can potentially write **225 bytes**, their values can be anything between 1 and 252, but we're restricted to write strictly increasing sequences of values (one sequence per patch stage, the lowest value for the first sequence being 191).

Note: Another thing we could do is to force the other player to write 0xFE in a memory region which doesn't belong to their received payload: The second patch list can have any offset value between 1 and 252 but the actual patchable payload is 147 bytes long (which is the remaining second half, take a look at the offsets at the [Stages](#stages) section). If we sent a malicious patch list with offsets higher than 0x93, then the other gameboy will happily write 0xFE in a memory area which is beyond the payload to be patched. 106 Bytes after the payload area can be written (offsets 0x94 to 0xFC).

#### Trade Request

</div>

<p align="center"><img src="/docs/assets/images/gen_1_request.png" alt="Players offer to trade one of their pokemon" style="width:500px;"/></p>

* Here, both players are in the trade menu, they can see the properties of each pokemon (in both parties) and may offer to send any of their pokemon to the opposing player. They may also exit the menu at any moment.

* Seeing pokemon properties won't trigger any exchange as the entire party data had already been exchanged.

* The slave gameboy will have to wait for the master to make a choice (because slaves can't initiate an exchange on their own). If the slave chooses something first it'll keep waiting for the master (there's not timeout).

* Once the master offers a pokemon (or exits the menu) it will repeatedly send that action until the slave also chooses to do something (there's no timeout).
  
* When both players select an action the master will send several **0x00** to acknowledge the selections. The slave will also respond with an acknowledge.
  
* Actions are encoded as **0x6X**, where X is the **party index** of the selected pokemon (0 to 5).
  
* **0x6F** represents the **exit menu** action, **if both players choose that option they'll return to the [[Players Ready for Trade](#players-ready-for-trade)] stage**.
  
* If only one player chooses to exit while the other one chose to trade something, then the selection process will reset and both players will have to make a new choice.

* **GLITCH**: Players can send indexes higher than their party sizes (e.g index 3 on a party of size 2, or even **index 14 (0x6E)**). If the index is less than 6 then players will interpret it as the last pokemon of the sender's party (the last pokemon is repeated until 6 pokemon structures are sent). Indexes higher than 5 will trigger an **out of bounds memory read** which will interpret those random 44 bytes as a pokemon.
  * For example, an index of 10 will read 44 bytes starting at index **440** (10*44). This invalid memory read happens in both games.
  * I'm not sure what would happend if that glitch "pokemon" was traded (the bytes at that memory location will be copied/moved, and overwritten!), it may break both games.

Examples:

<div align="center">

Master keeps sending its action for a long time until the slave chooses what to do:

#### Trade Confirmation

</div>


* Once both players chose to send one of their pokemon, a confirmation dialog will appear. They can either start the trade or cancel:

  * (Slave only) 0x00 is sent when still deciding what to do.
  * **0x61** is sent when cancelling the trade.
  * **0x62** is sent when confirming the trade.
 
* The master will repeatedly send its choice until the slave also chooses something, otherwise it'll respond with 0x00. There's no timeout.
* If the master hasn't decided yet, the slave will wait for it forever (there's no timeout).
* Once both players have decided, they'll keep sending their choices (usually 14 times), followed by a stream of 0x00 (usually 9 times).

* If either one cancels the trade while the other one confirmed it, then both will return to the trade menu and pick a new pokemon to send (or exit).

* When both players confirm the trade, the trading process will start.

<div align="center">

#### Trade Sequence

</div>

* Both players will see the trade animation, **nothing is sent during that sequence** (maybe because gameboys need some time to process the exchange).
  * Evolutions are hardcoded, if a Kadabra, Machoke, Haunter or Graveler is traded both gameboys will independently start their evolve animation.
  * **I think developers decided this to avoid complicating the protocol**.
  * Just sending the player's input (pressing 'B') to the other side won't work:
    * Players have a limited time to cancel evolutions, pressing 'B' at the last millisecond could cause the games to become out of sync.
    * Nothing else has a limited time to send an input (not even in battles).
  * A possible solution could be 'pausing' the evolution animation indefinitely and wait for the player's 'B' input (if any).
  * Anyway, **this is why players can't cancel cancel evolutions**. Also probably the reason why everstones were introduced!

* Once it ends, the master will repeatedly send 0x62 (14 times) followed by a stream of 0x00 (9 times), the slave returns this same sequence.
  
* That exchange happens two times ((14) 0x62, (9) 0x00, (14) 0x62, (9) 0x00).

* **I haven't tested what happens if unexpected sequences are sent** (sorry!), so what i just described is only the normal exchange.
  
* After all this, players return to [Seed Exchange](#seed-exchange). Players need to exchange their party data once more (because their party just changed!)

### Generation II

<div align="center">

#### Handshake


Exactly the same as in Gen I: [\[Gen I\] Handshake](#handshake)

</div>


<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Players Ready

</div>

* Works like in Gen I ([\[Gen I\] Players Ready](#players-ready)) but with a different ready signal: It is **0x61** instead of 0x60.

* This difference allows Gen II games to detect Gen I games at a very early stage (they'll send 0x60). If that was the case Gen II games will abort the connection at the next stage, players will see the message: "*You can't link to the past here.*".

* Gen I games will accept any ready message as long as its highest nibble is 6 (0x**6**X).


<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Room Selection

</div>

* Gen II games don't have to select a room because players are required to head to different physical locations depending on whether they want to trade or to battle.
* HOWEVER, **room selection is still part of the protocol**, this time the games will handle this part automatically.
* Messages are almost the same as in Gen I: [\[Gen I\] Room Selection)](#room-selection):
  * MENU MSG prefix stays the same, its first nibble has to be *0xD*
  * The following nibble is similar to Gen I with some differences:
    * Now it doesn't make sense to press A/B or to cancel the room selection (Room is already decided when talking to the corresponding NPC):
      * **0xD1**: Trade (In Gen I it was 0xD4).
      * 0xD2: Battle (In Gen I it was 0xD5).
      * 0xD**Y** (Y being Anything else): Players will be disconnected (with a message that says the other player chose a different room).
* When Gen II games detect that the other player is trying to connect from a Gen I game (see previous section), they'll send **0xDE**:
  * By Gen I standards it means that both 'A' and 'B' are pressed and that cancel was being selected, it's basically a double cancel.
  * Games will disconnect after that.

<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Players Ready for Trade

</div>

* Serves the same purpose as in Gen I but **messages are different**:
  * Master sends a stream of **0x75** (usually 14 times), followed by 0x00 (10 times). The same sequence is expected from the slave.
  * Master then sends a stream of **0x76** (also 14 times) followed by 0x00. Slave has to mirror this as well.
  * Slave can delay its response by some time (by sending anything else, usually 0x00), but now **there is a timeout**, several seconds for 0x75 and just a few seconds for 0x76.
  * I haven't tested if slaves also have a timeout while waiting for their master to transmit this sequence.

#### Party Information Exchange

</div>

* It's the same as in Gen I ([\[Gen I\] Party Information Exchange](#party-information-exchange)) but with a bigger payload: It is now **441 bytes long** (instead of 415 bytes in Gen I).
* Same restrictions apply (no 0xFE inside the payload or i'll break things).
* As with Gen I, 0xFE is patched (See [Patch Section](#patch-section-1)).

<hr>

<div align="center">

#### Data Structure

</div>

* This structure contains almost the same information as in Gen I, some fields were added, while others were moved to different offsets, a few useless fields were removed. I'll describe everything below.
  
* Strings: At least in english, the Gen II character encoding is compatible with Gen I, only glitched characters differ.
  * As with Gen I, encodings are well documented here: [Bulbapedia-> Character Encoding (Generation II)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Character_encoding_(Generation_II)).

##### Pokemon Id List (EGGS)!

</div>

* Same purpose as in Gen I.
* Pokemon ids are now their pokedex number (no more hidden ids!).
* **Now it's also used for eggs!**:
  * When a pokemon is still an egg its ID will be **0xFD** here, this is a reserved pokemon id. This is the **only** difference between an egg and a normal pokemon.
  * The type of pokemon that will hatch from this egg is specified in their [Pokemon Structure](#pokemon-structure-x6-1).
  * This is the only (valid) case where an ID in this list should not match the corresponding pokemon's ID.

<br><br>


<div align="center">

##### Trainer Id

</div>

* **This field was added in Gen II**
* Specifies the Trainer ID of the player that is currently trading (i don't recall it being shown anywhere, so it may be useless).
* This is the first field that **can be patched**.

<br><br>

<div align="center">

##### Pokemon Structure (x6)

</div>

* This structure is 48 bytes long (instead of 44 bytes in Gen I).
* The structure is somewhat documented here: [Bulbapedia -> Pokemon Data Structure (Generation II)](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_data_structure_(Generation_II))
* The fields for Type 1 and Type 2 were removed, they're calculated based on the pokemon species (Gen I also did this so those fields were essentially useless).
* Box level was also removed (it was also useless).
  
* Most of the remaining fields are the same as in Gen I, so'll just mention the differences:
  * Id Number: It's now the pokedex index of this pokemon (instead of a hidden ID).
    * **Hybrid pokemon cannot be traded** (when this value differs from the one in the [Pokemon Id List](#pokemon-id-list-eggs), then the pokemon is regarded as an [unstable hybrid pokemon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Unstable_hybrid_Pok%C3%A9mon). Eggs are the exception (when the id in the list is 0xFD then this pokemon is an egg).
    * Games have a specific check for these fields, if it fails then it informs that the pokemon is **abnormal** and can't be traded.
  * Held Item Id: The item which the current pokemon is holding, most of them can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> List of items by index number](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_items_by_index_number_(Generation_II)).
    * Some invalid items are converted into valid ones (hardcoded rules, most of those ids correspond to common catch rates in Gen I).
    * More information can be found on [The Cutting Room Floor -> Pokemon Gold & Silver -> Items](https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver/Items) and [Glitch City -> Obtaining arbitrary items in G/S/C through Time Capsule](https://archives.glitchcity.info/forums/board-108/thread-6719/page-0.html)
    * This is the list of convertion rules:
   
    <div align="center">
      
    | Item Id |     Name      | Converted to |
    |---------|---------------|--------------|
    |  0x19   | Teru-sama     | Leftovers    |
    |  0x2d   | Teru-sama     | Bitter Berry |
    |  0x32   | Teru-sama     | Gold Berry   |
    |  0x5A   | Teru-sama     | Berry        |
    |  0x64   | Teru-sama     | Berry        |
    |  0x78   | Teru-sama     | Berry        |

    |  0x87   | Teru-sama     | Berry        |
    |  0x8E   | Teru-sama     | Berry        |
    |  0xC3   | TM04 (Glitch) | Berry        |
    |  0xDC   | TM28 (Glitch) | Berry        |

    |  0xFF   | HM13          | Berry        |
 
    </div>

* Moving on:
  * Indexes of moves 1 to 4: Same as Gen I, new moves were added in Gen II, so more move Ids are available.
  * Original Trainer ID number: Same as in Gen I.
  * Experience Points: Same as in Gen I.
  * EV Data (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special): Same as in Gen I. Special EV is shared between special Attack and special Defense.
  * IV Data: Same as in Gen I.
  * PP Values of moves 1 to 4: Same as in Gen I.
  * **Friendship / Remaining Egg Cycles** (1 byte):
    * If not an egg (Id in [Pokemon Id List](#pokemon-id-list-eggs) is NOT 0xFD) then the value will be interpreted as friendship, otherwise it's the cycles remaining for the egg to hatch.
    * **A pokemon's friendship value will reset to its base value when trading it, even if it's traded back!**. Base values can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> List of Pokemon by Base Friendship](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_friendship)
    * Even if friendship resets when trading, it's nice to actually be able to see this value!
    * An egg cycle represents **256 steps**, once the player walks that many steps the cycle count will decrease by 1, if it reaches 0 the egg will hatch.
    * I haven't tested if this value resets as well.
  * **Pokerus** (1 byte):  Highest nibble is the strain of the virus, lowest nibble stores the remaining days for the pokemon to become cured. If a pokemon has or had pokerus, then it'll earn double EVs after battles.
    * If strain and remaining days are not zero, then the pokemon is currently infected.
    * If strain is not zero but remaining days is zero then the pokemon is cured, it can't be infected again.
    * Remaining days decrease by one after midnight.
    * Trading a pokemon to Gen I and back will erase this information, curing it or allowing it to get infected once more.
    * More information: [Bulbapedia -> Pokerus -> Technical Information](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9rus#Technical_information).
  * **Caught Data** (2 bytes):
    * Pokemon caught in Gen I or in Gold/Silver will have 0x00 in this field.
    * In Pokemon Crystal it stores information about their capture:
      * The first 2 bits record the time of day (1: Morning, 2: Day, 3: Night)
      * The 6 following bits record their level (up to 63).
      * The first bit of the second bite stores the Original Trainer's gender (0: Male, 1: Female)
      * The last 7 bits stores where it was captured. A list of locations can be found here: [Bulbapedia -> List of Locations by Index Number](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_locations_by_index_number_(Generation_II))
      * Trading a pokemon to Gen I and back will erase this information.
  * Level: Same as in Gen I. **Pokemon with a level higher than 100 will be considered abnormal and cannot be traded.**
  * Status Condition: Same as in Gen I.
  * **Unused Byte**: Always 0x00.
  * Current HP: Same as in Gen I.
  * Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense): Special stat was split into Special Attack and Special Defense, they share the same EV and IV. Base values may differ and depend on each species.

<div align="center">

##### Original Owner Name (x6)

Similar to Gen I, but names end with an extra terminator (0x50) instead of one. Nothing happens if a name has only a single terminator.

</div>
<br><br>


<div align="center">

##### Pokemon Nickname (x6)

Same as in Gen I, Egg names are always "EGG" followed by a single string terminator (0x50) and then zeros (instead of only string terminators as with other pokemon names). Nothing happens if the egg's name is not EGG.

</div>
<br><br>


<div align="center">

##### Zeros (x3)

</div>


* In Gen I these 3 bytes were the first bytes of the player's pokedex data (which were a bit field of owned pokemon). They were probably being transmitted by mistake.
* It seems that Gen II fixed this issue and now will only send 3 **0x00** no matter what happens in the player's pokedex. I'm not sure why they weren't removed entirely.



<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Patch Section

</div>

* Same principle as in Gen I: [\[Gen I\] Patch Section](#patch-section)
* Stage 2 is a little longer (because the total payload is 26 bytes longer (441 instead of 415).
* The patch limit stays at 190 (buffer is still 200):
  * The source code for Gen II games made me realize that those first 10 bytes were probably reserved for patching seeds but this was later discarded: [Pokegold -> Link.asm#L590](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/5140706094cd39bdfcd50f2e9eab33c25b03ad12/engine/link/link.asm#L590)
  * **The buffer overflow was fixed**: [Pokegold -> Link.asm#L593-597](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/5140706094cd39bdfcd50f2e9eab33c25b03ad12/engine/link/link.asm#L593-L597)
  * The other game can still send offsets beyond the patch area forcing it to write 0xFE at those offsets: [Pokegold -> Link.asm#L297-318](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/5140706094cd39bdfcd50f2e9eab33c25b03ad12/engine/link/link.asm#L297-L318)

#### Mail Information Exchange

</div>

* Gen II games introduced Mails, which are special held items. Players can write text messages into mails (before attaching them to a pokemon). Once attached they can't be modified any further.
* Pokemon holding mails can be traded, so those messages need to be exchanged!
* Each mail is stored in **47 bytes**. So a player with a full party of 6 pokemon, each holding a mail will need to send an additional **282 bytes**.
  
* **Even if no pokemon has attached mails, those 282 bytes will still be exchanged!**:
  * [**Information Disclosure**] Games don't ever erase memory addresses that store mail information (of mails attached to pokemon in the player's party).
  * This means that if a mail is attached to a pokemon and then removed, **the information is still there** (and is sent to the other player). It'll only change when another mail is attached.
  * Games didn't really care about this because even if this information was sent, the other player wouldn't be able to read it (the only legal way to access it is by receiving a pokemon with a held mail).
  * So, yes, we can read the contents of every attached mail even before receiving the pokemon that holds it, and **we can even read contents of deleted/removed mails**.
 
* First thing's first, there's a **preamble** before exchanging the payload, this time it is a stream of six **0x20**:

<br> 
<div align="center">

Mail Preamble
  
| #MSG    | MASTER | SLAVE|
|---------|--------|------|
|X        | 0x20  | 0x00 |
|X+1      | 0x20  | 0x20 |
|X+2      | 0x20  | 0x20 |
|X+3      | 0x20  | 0x20 |
|X+4      | 0x20  | 0x20 |
|X+5      | 0x20  | 0x20 |
|X+6      | MAIL DATA  | 0x20 |
|X+7      | MAIL DATA  | MAIL DATA |

</div>

* Why 0x20 instead of 0xFD? My guess is that those 6 bytes were intended to represent the **length of each mail**, but that idea was later discarded to simplify the protocol and now every mail has a fixed text length of 32 (0x20) bytes.

<hr>
<br>
<div align="center">

#### Mail Data Structure

</div>

* Mails are divided into 2 sections:
  * Mail contents (**33 bytes**): This is the message of the mail, one byte is reserved for a mandatory line break, the content itself has a maximum length of 32.
  * Mail Metadata (**14 Bytes**): Extra information about the mail.

* If **0xFE** (character '8') is contained within a mail's message then it'll be replaced with **0x21** (which is not a valid character):
  * The other end will revert any **0x21** back to **0xFE**. **This is much simpler than a patch section**.
* If a mail metadata contains **0xFE** then it'll also be patched with **0x21** but this part cannot be unpatched so easily:
  * Mail metadata can normally contain **any** value (including 0x21), so the other end cannot distinguish between an authentic 0x21 and a patched 0x21. **A mail patch section is needed**:

The payload itself is composed of:

<br><br>
<div align="center">

#### Contents (x6)

</div>

* These are the mail contents of each pokemon in the player's party:
  * The contents can be up to 33 bytes of length but one byte is reserved for a line break (resulting in 2 lines of 16 characters each).
  * We can create a mail without line breaks, it won't be displayed correctly but nothing else breaks (pun intended).
  * If the content is less than 32 bytes, the message ends with a string terminator (**0x50**), any extra bytes are just 0x00.
  * Any 0xFE will be ignored (which shouldn't be there to begin with!).
  * Sending 0x21 will make the other end to interpret it as '8'.

<br><br>
<div align="center">

#### Metadata (x6)

</div>

* Mail metadata consists of:
    * Author's name (displayed at the bottom of the message, **10 bytes**). It is 1 byte shorter than the other strings, but the eleventh byte was reserved for the string terminator, so there isn't a problem here.
    * Author's trainer ID (not shown, **2 bytes**).
    * The species (pokedex number) of the pokemon that first held this mail (**1 byte**).
    * The type of mail (item ID, **1 byte**), there're many types of mails, each one has a different background image. **It is not used** (the games use the *held item ID* field in the pokemon data structure).

 * Any of those fields could potentially have 0xFE in them (Although only the Trainer ID field can contain 0xFE without any glitches). It'll be replaced with **0x21** and its offset will be sent later (in the mail patch section).


<hr>

<div align="center">

#### Mail Patch Section

</div>

* Similar to the [Patch Section](#patch-section), players exchange a list of offsets which point to parts of the (already exchanged) mail information payload, specifically at bytes in the [metadata](#metadata-x6) section.
* Mail [contents](#contents-x6) didn't need a patch section (0xFE was replaced with 0x21 (a value that **never** appears in mail contents) and then **every** 0x21 was changed back to 0xFE).
* Metadata can contain **any value** (from 0x00 to 0xFF), so the approach used for mail contents couldn't be used here.
  
* Only one list needs to be exchanged because the 6 metadata structures combined are just 84 bytes long. The [Patch Section](#patch-section) needed 2 lists because the patchable size was over 255 bytes.
* This list also ends with **0xFF**.
* There's no preamble, so the list starts immediately after the last byte of the mails payload.
* Offset values range from 0x01 to [NOT CONFIRMED] 0xFC.
* Any 0XFE will be ignored, as if nothing was sent.
* **102 bytes are always exchanged**. This ensures that even in the worst case players can patch **all** the bytes in the metadata section.
* After players finish sending their lists they will repeatedly send **0x00** until 102 bytes are exchanged.


<div align="center">

In this example, the Trainer ID of player 1 is 43518 (0xA9**FE**), this means that every mail attached by this player will have at least one byte to be patched (which corresponds to that ID).
Player 1 has 6 pokemon, only the first and the last one have attached mails. Player 2 doesn't have any pokemon holding a mail.

#### Trade Request

Same as in [Gen I](#trade-request) except that the choice prefix is **0x7X** instead of 0x6X, (**0x70** to **0x75** to choose a pokemon, **0x7F** to exit the menu).

#### Trade Sequence

</div>

* Similar to [Gen I](#trade-sequence), nothing is sent while the trade animation is playing. Everstones prevent Kadabra, Graveler, Haunter, and Machoke from evolving.
* After the trade is complete there's also a confirmation sequence, which consists in **0x7X** (usually 14 times) followed by **0x00** (10 times):
  * For most traded pokemon this byte will be **0x70**.
  * If the player sent a **Mew** the value will be **0x71**.
  * If the player sent a **Celebi** the value will be **0x72**.
  * I'm not sure why this value changes with Mew and Celebi, the games don't seem to care about it. The assembly code can be found here: [Pokegold -> Link.asm#L1827-1852](https://github.com/pret/pokegold/blob/5140706094cd39bdfcd50f2e9eab33c25b03ad12/engine/link/link.asm#L1827-L1852).
 
* After that sequence both games return to [Players Ready for Trade](#players-ready-for-trade-1).

<div align="center">

Example: Master sent a normal pokemon, slave sent a Celebi:

### Time Capsule

Gen II games can use the time capsule to trade with Gen I games, they'll **act almost exactly as a [Gen I](generation-i) game** except for a few things:

* At the [Players Ready](#players-ready-1) stage they'll send **0x61** instead of 0x60:
  * Gen I games will accept any message that starts with 0x6X.
  * Gen II games can detect whether or not the other player is in fact a Gen I game or a Gen II game which is also using the time capsule, if that's the case it'll disconnect. **Trading between 2 Gen II games through the time capsule isn't allowed**.
* Gen II games don't send the single 0xFE before signaling that they're ready, see [Players Ready for trade](#players-ready-for-trade).
* If its party is less than 6, then it'll fill the remaining bytes of the [Pokemon Id List](#pokemon-id-list) with **0x00** instead of **0xFF** (it still sends a single 0xFF to terminate the list).
* It won't trade any pokemon above level 100, considering it abnormal.
* Gen II games won't accept pokemon whose typing fields don't match the types of that pokemon species. (E.g a grass type Mewtwo).
  * Magnemite and Magneton are the exception. their types changed between Gen I (electric/electric) and Gen II (electric/steel). It'll accept a magnemite/magneton of ANY type (e.g Psychic Fire). Although those values will be discarded as Gen II games don't store types per pokemon, they'll just look at the types of the species instead.
  * Most glitch pokemon in Gen I don't have the same types as their corresponding Gen II pokemon, that's why they can't be traded. Modifying their type values will make Gen II games accept them.
  * **Gen II games can see and accept Gen II only pokemon coming from a Gen I game**. (For example the glitch Gen I pokemon ['M 'N g](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/%27M_%27N_g) is seen as a Celebi by Gen II games, if the Gen I player manages to modify its type from Rock/Ground to Psychic/Grass then Gen II games will accept it (and receive a Celebi)!
* Gen II games will recalculate the Special Attack / Special Defense stats of the received pokemon (The "Special" stat that Gen I games send is discarded). Other stats are unaffected.
* Friendship/Pokerus/Caught Data information will be permanently erased.
* Shininess/gender information is preserved between trades (it's stored in the pokemon's IV data).
* Shiny Pokemon can be obtained in Gen I games, but only Gen II games can see it.
* **Everstones won't work** (We're in a simulated Gen I environment).
